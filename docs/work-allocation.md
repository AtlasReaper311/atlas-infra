# Atlas Systems - Work Allocation

Living coordination document for agents currently working on Atlas Systems. This is not architecture or policy. It records who is doing what now so separate sessions do not silently duplicate or reverse each other.

This file only has value while it remains current. Update or remove an entry as soon as its status changes.

Last updated: 2026-07-29.

## How to use this file

Before starting non-trivial multi-session work, check for an existing entry on the same repository or capability. When starting such work, add an active entry. When work finishes, pauses, blocks, or is abandoned, update the entry immediately.

Entry format:

```text
### <short title>

- Repo(s): repositories in scope
- Agent: agent or tool doing the work
- Status: active | paused | blocked | done
- Started: date
- Last updated: date
- Summary: what is being done and why
- Resume point: required only when paused or blocked
```

## Active work

### Public interface programme

- **Repo(s):** `atlas-infra`, `atlas-systems`, `atlas-interface-kit`, `atlas-api-public`, `atlas-api-index`, `status`, `atlas-doc-viewer`, `ramone-edge`, `atlas-article-gen`, `atlas-scheduler`
- **Agent:** Codex
- **Status:** active
- **Started:** 2026-07-28
- **Last updated:** 2026-07-29
- **Summary:** Phases 0 through 4B are complete. Draft `atlas-infra` PR #84 records the reproducible `atlas-interface-kit` `0.3.0` candidate at `630c8060ebe61b3f2234cd73ae983b5b41564c3b`, successful deployment provenance for the exact Phase 1 and Phase 3 merge commits, and current read-only verification of all five public routes. The evidence prerequisites for Phase 4C tag consideration are complete.
- **Current thread:** Review draft PR #84 and merge it only after explicit approval. After the documentation merge, request separate approval to create annotated tag `v0.3.0`. Do not publish a GitHub Release, update consumers, begin Phase 5, or deploy anything without the later approval gates.

### SPECULAR-CORE pending rollout

- **Repo(s):** `atlas-dep-audit`, `atlas-postmortem`, `atlas-blackbox`, `atlas-corpus`, `atlas-eval-harness`, `atlas-api-public`, `atlas-infra`, `ramone-memory`, `atlas-owui-tools`
- **Agent:** ChatGPT with Atlas operating on SPECULAR-CORE
- **Status:** active
- **Started:** 2026-07-28
- **Last updated:** 2026-07-29
- **Summary:** Complete the remaining SPECULAR-CORE rollout threads independently and one state-changing thread at a time. Thread A is complete using scheduled dependency-audit run `30263775549` against `fc565353c83f19d117ed3c3173d667429a672f66`. Thread B source implementation is complete and merged through `atlas-postmortem` PR #8 at `8cf8c0d2bec00dfc415dd76dcbaf3b3a65810491` and `atlas-owui-tools` PR #1 at `e35c9ff6913aecad027e297cb71e34993a5ad141`. The existing separate `ramone-postmortem` Open WebUI preset remains the conversational controller and is not the Ramone Agent. `atlas-postmortem` retains ownership of evidence retrieval, Corpus context, Ollama drafting, linting, local output, and processed-state recording. The controlled live rollout is prepared but has not been executed. The public-interface programme remains separately owned by Codex; its branches, pull requests, previews, and evidence are out of scope.
- **Current thread:** Thread B controlled live-rollout preparation and owner-run execution, with no service, secret, Open WebUI database, model assignment, or incident state changed yet.

## Standing ownership

| Area | Default owner | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Case study writing and the publishing pipeline | Atlas, agent-assisted | `atlas-article-gen` and `atlas-scheduler` documentation is authoritative. Agents inspect it before changing article generation, sequencing, refresh, or publication behaviour. |
| Repository governance and lifecycle | `atlas-infra` under ADR-0004 | Public repository classification changes begin in the authoritative policy inputs, never in generated projections. |
| Public interface authority | `atlas-infra` under ADR-0008 | Shared roles and non-overridable foundations are governed here. `atlas-interface-kit` implements accepted authority. |
| Interface-kit implementation and release | `atlas-interface-kit` | Consumers pin immutable repository-local bundles and verify fingerprints. |
| Model promotion evidence | `atlas-eval-harness` | Evidence-sensitive model choices require capability-specific evaluation before rollout. |
