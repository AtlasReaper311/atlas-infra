# Atlas Systems - Work Allocation

Living coordination document for agents currently working on Atlas Systems. This is not architecture or policy. It records who is doing what now so separate sessions do not silently duplicate or reverse each other.

This file only has value while it remains current. Update or remove an entry as soon as its status changes.

Last updated: 2026-07-28.

## How to use this file

Before starting non-trivial multi-session work, check for an existing entry on the same repository or capability. When starting such work, add an active entry. When work finishes, pauses, blocks, or is abandoned, update the entry immediately.

Entry format:

```text
### <short title>

- Repo(s): repositories in scope
- Agent: agent or tool doing the work
- Status: active | paused | blocked | done
- Started: date
- Last updated: date
- Summary: what is being done and why
- Resume point: required only when paused or blocked
```

## Active work

### Public interface programme

- **Repo(s):** `atlas-infra`, `atlas-systems`, `atlas-interface-kit`, `atlas-api-public`, `atlas-api-index`, `status`, `atlas-doc-viewer`, `ramone-edge`, `atlas-article-gen`, `atlas-scheduler`
- **Agent:** Codex
- **Status:** active
- **Started:** 2026-07-28
- **Last updated:** 2026-07-28
- **Summary:** Execute the evidence-backed public interface programme one approved phase at a time. Preserve independent deployment, publication, runtime, security, product identity, and AtlasField boundaries while producing focused draft pull requests and exact-head evidence.

## Standing ownership

| Area | Default owner | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Case study writing and the publishing pipeline | Atlas, agent-assisted | `atlas-article-gen` and `atlas-scheduler` documentation is authoritative. Agents inspect it before changing article generation, sequencing, refresh, or publication behaviour. |
| Repository governance and lifecycle | `atlas-infra` under ADR-0004 | Public repository classification changes begin in the authoritative policy inputs, never in generated projections. |
| Public interface authority | `atlas-infra` under ADR-0008 | Shared roles and non-overridable foundations are governed here. `atlas-interface-kit` implements accepted authority. |
| Interface-kit implementation and release | `atlas-interface-kit` | Consumers pin immutable repository-local bundles and verify fingerprints. |
| Model promotion evidence | `atlas-eval-harness` | Evidence-sensitive model choices require capability-specific evaluation before rollout. |
